# Flipkart Price Tracker

## Overview

This project enables you to track the prices of selected products on Flipkart using two Python scripts:

- `flipkart_tracker.py`: Create and manage a list of products in an Excel file.

- `main.py`: Monitor price changes of the tracked products and send email alerts for price drops.

## Purpose of Files

- `flipkart_tracker.py`: This script is used to create and manage a list of products you want to track on Flipkart. It scrapes product data from Flipkart web pages and stores it in an Excel file.

- `main.py`: This script continuously monitors the prices of the tracked products on Flipkart. If there's a price drop below the desired threshold, it sends an email alert.

## How It Works

1. **Adding Products to Track:**
   - Run `flipkart_tracker.py` to add products to the tracking list.
   - Provide the product links, and the script will scrape and store their details in an Excel file (`flipkart_tracker.xlsx`).

2. **Monitoring Price Drops:**
   - Run `main.py` to check the prices of the tracked products on Flipkart.
   - If a price drop is detected below the desired threshold, the script sends an email alert.

## Automation Options

- **Online Automation (Recommended):**
  - For online automation, consider using [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).
  - Upload `main.py` to PythonAnywhere along with the Excel file (`flipkart_tracker.xlsx`) generated by `flipkart_tracker.py`.
  - Set up a scheduled task on PythonAnywhere to run `main.py` at specified intervals.

- **Local Automation (Windows):**
  - To automate on your local machine (Windows), you can use Windows Task Scheduler.
  - Create a task that runs `main.py` at desired intervals.

**Note**: Ensure that the required Python libraries (`openpyxl`, `requests`, `bs4`, `yagmail`) are installed in the environment where you plan to run the scripts.

**Make sure to provide your email credentials in the main.py file and also select the reciever mail (By Default, It is mine)
Generate App Passwords and only they should be used as email credentials for safety reasons, (Research more about app passwords)**
